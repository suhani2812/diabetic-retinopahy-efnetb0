# Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Classification

This project uses a compact, efficient model based on EfficientNet B0 to classify the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) into five levels (0-4). The model is trained on a dataset of 33,700 retinal images and demonstrates strong performance, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices or low-powered machines.

## Dataset

You can download the full dataset along with labeled CSV files from [kaggle/aryananand18](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryananand18/diabetic-retinopathy).

## How to Run

1. Download the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) from this repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any Python environment that supports notebooks (e.g., Google Colab).
3. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision efficientnet_pytorch pandas scikit-learn
   pip install -r requirements.txt
